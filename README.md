â€”We explore techniques for imputing missing values
using machine learning. The presence of missing values is a
frequent problem encountered in data analysis and machine
learning applications. The purpose of this work is to create a data
imputation framework to impute values for a numerical dataset
using Generative Adversarial Networks. The approach discussed
attempts to provide an understandable solution through detailed
error analysis. Our analysis assesses the strength and weakness
of GAIN and demonstrates the potential and utility of using
GANs in multimodal and diverse UCI datasets. The framework
is based on an optimization of GAIN algorithm to impute missing
data with mixed continuous and categorical features for multiple
imputation with a visualisation toolkit to analyse errors.
